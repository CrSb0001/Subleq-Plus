Subleq Plus

Subleq+ is directly inspired by Lawrence Woodman's "Improving the Standard SUBLEQ OISC (One Instruction Set Computer) Architecture"
https://techtinkering.com/2009/05/15/improving-the-standard-subleq-oisc-architecture/

The parser and VM were taken from Chris Loyd https://github.com/cjrl/Python-Subleq and adapted for indirect references and creating compiled code.
